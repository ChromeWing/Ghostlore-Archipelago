# Ghostlore

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for Ghostlore](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All the items are shuffled across all participating worlds.  20 recipes granted to the player are drafted at random from the larger pool in a random order (i.e. Recipe 7 can be different between seeds).  There is also a setting for randomizing the sound effects and music for Ghostlore.

## What is the goal of Ghostlore when randomized?

There are two types of goals:
- `Complete Story`: Finish the last mainline story quest (this is when the endgame and Hell Gate Island is unlocked).
- `Clear Hell Gate X`: Finish the story quests, and reach endgame (Hell Gate Island).  Clear concecutive Hell Gate levels without dying until you've cleared level X (1, 3, or 10).

## Which items and locations get shuffled?

Each non-boss monster in the game has multiple kill quests associated with them (configurable in the settings).  These kill quests are the primary location checks in Ghostlore.  Each monster has varying amounts of kills required to complete their kill quest location check, depending on how often that monster appears.  The cooresponding items with these kill quests are a surplus of loot from those combined monsters in the kill quest.  Boss monsters only have one kill quest.  Any item shop in Ghostlore shares a collection of 20 Link Bracelets.  There are 20 randomly picked food recipes associated with the Link Bracelets.  The first 50 treasure chests (excluding quest item chests) opened are also locations, with 50 sets of 1000 coins.  The two main quest items, Chthonite and Astralite, are also items, alongside their respective chests as location checks.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

The kill quest loot for each monster and boss, the 20 randomly picked food recipes, 50 sets of 1000 coins, and Chthonite and Astralite quest items are all shuffled, which means any of them can be in another player's world.

## What happens if all location checks for a location category in Ghostlore are complete?

Completing all kill quests for monsters or bosses will show an indication that you have "conquered" that monster.  Conquered monsters/bosses will now drop loot on kill unconditionally.  After opening 50 treasure chests, each additional treasure chest opened will also drop loot unconditionally.

## What does another world's item look like in Ghostlore?

Since kill quests are considered abstract as a location, kill quests have no visuals for another world's item.  Treasure chests show no visuals for other world's items either.  The shop will show all Archipelago items as "Link Bracelets", representing a way to "link" items between worlds by purchasing the Link Bracelet.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Receiving a loot item in the multiworld will drop that loot around the player.  When receiving a food recipe, you will be notified, and can now access that recipe at the restaurant NPC in town.  Receiving 1000 coins will be added directly to your inventory.  The Chthonite and Astralite quest items will spawn near your character on receiving them.  If you happen to miss your opportunity to pick them up, it will spawn them at your feet again in the next zone.
