# Ghostlore Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

The game is available for purchase on the [Ghostlore Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783280/Ghostlore/) for Windows PCs.

Once installed, you will need to subscribe to the [Ghostlore Archipelago mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2843540693) on Steam Workshop.

## Installation Procedures

1. When Ghostlore is installed, subscribe to the [Ghostlore Archipelago mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2843540693) on Steam Workshop.
2. Start up Ghostlore.
3. Click the "Mods" button.  If Steam downloaded the mod properly, you should see the Archipelago mod appear on the mods list.  Toggle the mod on if it isn't already on.

## Joining a Multiworld Game

1. Make sure the mod is turned on, and click the "New Game" button on the main menu to create a new character.
2. Pick any name for your character as you wish (this is not your slot name, it will be prompted after), choose a class and hairstyle, and click "Create".
3. The mod should now prompt you for a slot name, ip address, port number, and password.  Enter the slot name that matches the Settings file you submitted, the ip address and port number provided by the host, and password if necessary.
4. After all information has been entered, click "Create" again and it will automatically connect you to Archipelago and start the game.  

### Rejoining the Multiworld

If you ever disconnect or save and exit the game, you can rejoin the multiworld by loading that same character created for the multiworld.  It will not reconnect you if the Archipelago mod in game is disabled.  It will automatically know to connect you to the same Archipelago server.  If you closed the game unexpectingly without saving, any Archipelago locations and items will still be retained, and reawarded to you when reentering the game.

## Finishing the Game

Depending on the goal you set, you will have to at least complete the story quests, as seen at the top of your questlog at any time in game.

If any of the `Clear Hell Gate` goal options were set, you will have to clear the cooresponding number of Hell Gate Island stages consecutively without dying.

Characters made for multiworlds in Ghostlore can continue playing long after the session has ended if you wish.  The mod should be disabled if you are not participating in a multiworld anymore.

## Toggling DeathLink

DeathLink is supported in Ghostlore.  It is defined in the options for your YAML file.  It can also be toggled in game with the F1 key, which will be indicated on the in game logs.  If reentering the game, your DeathLink toggle will be reset to whatever was defined in your YAML file, so be sure to retoggle it if you've toggled it before.

## Game Troubleshooting

### The game freezes when clicking "Create" a second time on the character creation screen

You may have set your slot name, ip address, port number, or password incorrectly.  Otherwise, the server may not currently be online, or the server host has not properly port forwarded the port number for the server.

### The game freezes when loading a character

See above: only have the Archipelago mod enabled if the cooresponding server is still hosting.
